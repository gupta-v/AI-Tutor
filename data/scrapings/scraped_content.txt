Hellois asalutationorgreetingin the English language. It is first attested in writing from 1826.[1]
Hello, with that spelling, was used in publications in the U.S. as early as the 18 October 1826 edition of theNorwich CourierofNorwich, Connecticut.[1]Another early use was an 1833 American book calledThe Sketches and Eccentricities of Col. David Crockett, of West Tennessee,[2]which was reprinted that same year inThe London Literary Gazette.[3]The word was extensively used in literature by the 1860s.[4]
According to theOxford English Dictionary,hellois an alteration ofhallo,hollo,[1]which came fromOld High German"halâ,holâ, emphatic imperative ofhalôn,holônto fetch, used especially in hailing a ferryman".[5]It also connects the development ofhelloto the influence of an earlier form,holla, whose origin is in the Frenchholà(roughly, 'whoa there!', from Frenchlà'there').[6]As in addition tohello,halloo,[7]hallo,hollo,hulloand (rarely)hilloalso exist as variants or related words, the word can be spelt using any of all five vowels.[8][9][10]
Before the telephone, verbal greetings often involved a time of day, such as "good morning". When the telephone began connecting people in different time zones, greetings without time gained popularity.[11]
Thomas Edisonis credited with popularizinghulloas a telephone greeting. In previous decades,hullohad been used as an exclamation of surprise (used early on byCharles Dickensin 1850)[12]andhalloowas shouted at ferry boat operators by people who wanted to catch a ride.[13]According to one account,halloowas the first word Edison yelled into his strip phonograph when he discovered recorded sound in 1877.[12]Shortly afterAlexander Graham Bellinvented the telephone, he answered calls by saying "ahoyahoy", borrowing the term used on ships.[13][14]There is no evidence the greeting caught on.[13]Edison suggestedHello!on August 15, 1877 in a letter to the president ofPittsburgh's Central District and Printing Telegraph Company, T. B. A. David:
Friend David, I do not think we shall need a call bell as Hello! can be heard 10 to 20 feet away.

The first name tags to includeHellomay have 1880 at Niagara Falls, which was the site of the first telephone operators convention. By 1889, central telephone exchange operators were known as "hello-girls" because of the association between the greeting and the telephone.[14][15]
A 1918 novel uses the spelling "Halloa" in the context of telephone conversations.[16]
Hellomight be derived from an older spelling variant,hullo, which the AmericanMerriam-Websterdictionary describes as a "chiefly British variant of hello",[17]and which was originally used as an exclamation to call attention, an expression of surprise, or a greeting.Hullois found in publications as early as 1803.[18]The wordhullois still in use, with the meaninghello.[19][20][21][22]
